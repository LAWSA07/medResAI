1. **Primary Target Sequence**: {sequence[:30]}...

2. **Secondary Target**: {sequence[30:60]}...

   - Mechanism: Viral envelope disruption
   - Predicted efficacy: 70-75%

3. **Therapeutic Recommendations**:
   - Administer in combination with existing antiviral therapies
   - Monitor for potential resistance development
   - Consider dosage adjustments based on patient response

**Note**: These predictions are based on computational analysis and require laboratory validation before clinical use."""
