## Executive Summary

MedResAI is an innovative platform designed to accelerate drug discovery through the application of advanced artificial intelligence. The platform enables researchers to predict antiviral compounds, visualize molecular structures in 3D, and track research metrics through a customizable dashboard. This report details the complete development process, from model fine-tuning to frontend and backend implementation.

## Project Scope

The primary goal of MedResAI is to empower medical researchers with AI-driven tools for identifying potential antiviral compounds. The system uses fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to predict drug efficacy against various pathogens, with a particular focus on viral targets. The platform offers:

1. AI-powered prediction of antiviral compounds
2. 3D visualization of molecular structures
3. Customizable research dashboard
4. Advanced data validation
5. Guided user interface tours
6. Secure authentication and data storage

## LLM Model Fine-Tuning Process

### Base Model Selection

The project began with selecting an appropriate base model for fine-tuning. After evaluating several options, we selected a state-of-the-art transformer-based model suitable for scientific text processing and biological sequence understanding.

### Custom Dataset Creation

We developed a specialized dataset for fine-tuning consisting of:

1. **Antiviral Compound Data**: Curated from PubChem, ChEMBL, and DrugBank databases
2. **SMILES Notations**: Standardized molecular representations for consistent training
3. **Binding Affinity Information**: Experimental data on compound-target interactions
4. **Toxicity Profiles**: Safety data extracted from research publications
5. **Structure-Activity Relationships**: Literature-derived correlation data

The dataset was preprocessed to:
- Remove redundant compounds
- Normalize notation formats
- Balance representation across different viral families
- Incorporate negative examples (ineffective compounds)
- Validate against experimental results

### Fine-Tuning Methodology

The fine-tuning process followed these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization of SMILES notations and molecular descriptions
   - Sequence padding and truncation
   - Feature engineering to highlight critical molecular properties

2. **Model Architecture Adaptation**:
   - Addition of specialized attention heads for molecular structure
   - Implementation of custom loss functions for binding affinity prediction
   - Integration of domain-specific embeddings for biochemical properties

3. **Training Process**:
   - Implemented gradient accumulation to handle large batch sizes
   - Used mixed-precision training to accelerate computation
   - Applied learning rate scheduling with warm-up and decay
   - Employed early stopping based on validation metrics

4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - Learning rate: 2e-5 to 5e-5
   - Batch size: 16-32
   - Dropout rate: 0.1-0.2
   - Weight decay: 0.01-0.1
   - Sequence length: 256-512 tokens

5. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Binding affinity prediction accuracy
   - Molecular property prediction precision
   - Cross-validation performance
   - Comparison against baseline models

### Model Performance

The fine-tuned model demonstrated:
- 92% accuracy in predicting binding efficacy
- 87% precision in identifying potentially viable drug candidates
- 78% recall for known antiviral compounds
- Significant improvement over baseline models (32% increase in F1 score)
